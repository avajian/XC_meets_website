# Cross Country Meets Website 🏃🏻‍♀️
Design project for SI 339: Web Design & Accessibility 💻

The website uses python to process data from csv files and create templated html files, these files become the pages displayed in index.html.
The website handles mobile, tablet and desktop view and has been thoroughly checked for accessibility both through automated tools
like WAVE and aXe, and also manually.
